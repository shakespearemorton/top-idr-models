# top-idr-models
A streamlined pipeline for generating phase diagrams using state-of-the-art models. Supports simulations with the Calvados (OpenMM) and mpipi (LAMMPS) force fields. Automates data preparation, simulation execution, and checkpointing, allowing for flexible configuration and efficient analysis in molecular dynamics research.
